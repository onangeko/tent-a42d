==== SDL2 Demo ====

This code is designed to be compatible with Android! 

Before to compile it for Android system, you can still compile it for
your Linux system (assuming SDL2 is well installed).

$ make                 # this Makefile will be ignore by Android build system
$ cp ../../assets/* .  # copy ressources in the current directory
$ ./demo               # run it on your Linux PC
